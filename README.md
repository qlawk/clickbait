# Clickbait: News Headline Classification

## Objective
Classifying news networks by sensational headline score using Natural Language Processing. In doing so, also determine which news networks have the most clickbait headlines and find out what criteria best determines sensationalism.

## Rationale
Everyone encounters so much information everyday, so I wanted to originally combat news misinformation. However, developing a fact checking algorithm seemed non-feasible so I tackled sensationalized news headlines, or in modern terms - 'clickbait'. Clickbait is described by dictionary.com as "a sensationalized headline...designed to entice people".
